# MVP
This MVP was coded completely from scratch by the founder of PeerAtlas, Brad Mattson MD, with the help of co-founders Colin Closser MD and Ling Wu PhD. Brad is not an expert coder and recognizes that there are several bugs in his code.

The MVP is a very basic demonstration of how medical algorithms and articles can be used to create a completely free and open-source medical encyclopedia. The MVP should not be considered a final product and PeerAtlas plans to completely rebuild the software with a team of professional coders after the ATLAS token sale.
